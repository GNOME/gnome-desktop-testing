.SH DESCRIPTION

.BR gnome-desktop-testing-runner ,
also known as
.BR ginsttest-runner ,
runs "as-installed" tests. These tests are discovered using metadata in
files named \fBinstalled-tests/**/*.test\fR, and are intended to check
that a library or program is functioning correctly and has been installed
correctly by a system integrator such as an OS distributor or system
administrator.

.PP
Tests in this format are typically provided by GNOME-related libraries,
but the concept, format and tools are not GNOME-specific and can be used
by any software.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
\fB--dir=\fIDIR\fR, \fB-d\fR \fIDIR\fR
Look for test metadata in the \fBinstalled-tests\fR subdirectory of
\fIDIR\fR, instead of using \fB$XDG_DATA_DIRS\fR. If repeated, each \fIDIR\fR
is searched in order.

.TP
\fB--first-root\fR
Stop after a directory that contains \fBinstalled-tests\fR has been
encountered.

.TP
\fB--list\fR, \fB-l\fR
Don't run any tests. Instead, list what would have been run on standard
output, one per line, in the format \fINAME\fB (\fIPATH\fB)\fR.

.TP
\fB--log-directory=\fIDIR\fR, \fB-L\fR \fIDIR\fR
Write the output of each test to a file \fIDIR\fB/\fINAME\fB.txt\fR.

.TP
\fB--log-msgid=\fIMSGID\fB=\fIMESSAGE\fR
Don't run any tests. Instead, emit a log message to the systemd Journal
with the unique machine-readable message ID \fIMSGID\fR and the
human-readable message \fIMESSAGE\fR. This can be used to mark important
points in the test log from a test written in a language where direct
access to the Journal is awkward, such as shell script or JavaScript.

.TP
\fB--parallel=\fIPROC\fR, \fB-p\fR \fIPROC\fR
Run up to \fIPROC\fR tests in parallel. The default is 1, meaning do not
run tests in parallel. If \fIPROC\fR is 0 or omitted, detect the number of
CPUs and run that many tests in parallel.

.TP
\fB--quiet\fR
Don't output test results, just log them to the systemd Journal
if supported.

.TP
\fB--report-directory=\fIDIR\fR
Run each test with \fIDIR\fB/\fINAME\fR as its current working directory,
and write its output to a file \fIDIR\fB/\fINAME\fB/output.txt\fR.
If the test succeeds, the directory is deleted. If the test fails, the
directory is kept for analysis, including any temporary files or logs
that the test itself might have written there.

.TP
\fB--status=yes\fR|\fBno\fR|\fBauto\fR
Output a status message every few seconds if a test takes a significant
time to run.

.TP
\fB--tap\fR
Output machine-readable test results on standard output, in the format
specified by TAP (the
.UR https://testanything.org/
Test Anything Protocol
.UE
originally used by Perl's test suite).

.TP
\fB--timeout=\fISECONDS\fR, \fB-t\fR \fISECONDS\fR
If a test takes longer than \fISECONDS\fR seconds to run, terminate it.
The default is 5 minutes (300 seconds).

.TP
\fIPREFIX\fR [\fIPREFIX\fR...]
Only list or run tests that match one of these prefixes, relative to the
.B installed-tests
directory.

.SH EXIT STATUS

.TP
0
All tests were successful, or \fB--list\fR or \fB--log-msgid\fR was
successful

.TP
1
An error occurred during options parsing, setup or testing

.TP
2
The tests were run, and least one failed

.SH ENVIRONMENT

.TP
XDG_DATA_DIRS
Used to discover tests if \fB--dir\fR, \fB-d\fR is not specified.

.SH FILES

.TP
/usr/local/share/installed-tests/**/*.test
Conventional location for metadata describing tests installed by
locally-installed software.

.TP
/usr/share/installed-tests/**/*.test
Conventional location for metadata describing tests installed by the
operating system packages.

.TP
/usr/local/libexec/installed-tests/**, /usr/libexec/installed-tests/**
Conventional location for test executables and the data files they
require (although this is not required, and they can be installed in any
convenient location).

.TP
.RB ./.testtmp
Each test will be invoked in a temporary directory containing only this
file. Tests can use this to avoid overwriting important files if run
without using
.BR gnome-desktop-testing-runner .

.SH EXAMPLE

To run the tests from the
.B json-glib
library:
.nf
.RS
ginsttest-runner json-glib-1.0/
.RE
.fi

.PP
To run the tests from the
.BR dbus ,
.B glib
and
.B json-glib
libraries, with up to one process per CPU, producing machine-readable
output and storing results of any failed tests in a directory:
.nf
.RS
ginsttest-runner \\
    --parallel=0 \\
    --report-directory=artifacts \\
    --tap \\
    dbus/ glib/ json-glib-1.0/
.RE
.fi
